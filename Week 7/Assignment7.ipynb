        "Statistical significance is a measure that helps determine whether the result of an analysis is likely to be genuine or if it could have occurred by chance. It is typically assessed using a p-value, which is a probability that measures the evidence against a null hypothesis (H₀). The p-value helps assess whether the observed effect or relationship is likely due to random variation or whether it represents a true underlying pattern.\n",

To assess the statistical significance of an insight, start by defining a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (Ha) where the null hypothesis typically states that there is no significant effect or relationship, and the alternative hypothesis suggests that there is a significant effect or relationship.\n",
